             <p>
             	Garlic bread (also called garlic toast)[1] consists of bread (usually a baguette or sour dough like a ciabatta), topped with garlic and olive oil or butter and may include additional herbs, such as oregano or chives.[2] It is then either grilled or broiled until toasted or baked in a conventional or bread oven.[2]

                It is typically made using a French baguette, or sometimes a sourdough like ciabatta which is 
                partially sliced downwards, allowing the condiments to soak into the loaf while keeping it in one piece. The bread is then stuffed through the cuts with oil and minced garlic before baking. Alternatively, butter and garlic powder are used, or the bread is cut lengthwise into separate slices which are individually garnished.

                Some variants are topped with a variety of cheeses, often mozzarella, parmesan, cheddar or feta. Some restaurants use clarified butter in place of olive oil.

             	History
                Garlic bread stems from bruschetta,[3][4] which appeared in Italy around the 15th century, and can be traced back to Ancient Rome.[5]

                Europe
                Garlic bread is widely popular across Europe, and is available in many different food shops and restaurants.

                In German-speaking countries, it is known as Knoblauchbrot.
                In Greece, garlic bread often contains olives and onions.
                In France, it was common in Provence, where it was called chapon and served with salad.[6] It was also prepared in other regions, such as Quercy, as a crust of bread rubbed with garlic, and spiced with a pinch of salt and a drop of walnut oil.[7]
                In England, butter is used instead of olive oil in garlic bread.[8]
